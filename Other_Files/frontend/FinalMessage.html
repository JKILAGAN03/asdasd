        Eto yung wish na ginawa ko as 2025 comes to an end. I made this
        realization na I want god to make you happy because of the talk I had
        with one of the priest that is close to my life. Nakita ko sya actually
        this December, and we exchange greetings. He then ask how's my love life
        (di pa kita nakukwento sa kanya, so he's asking for Mary). I said what
        happened, and I tell him about this beautiful, amazing girl I met and be
        friends with. We exchange conversations, and he mentioned me that "A man
        should serve God if he is single, and serve his spouse if he is married
        to one. Di pa naman kayo kasal, just wish to God for her to be happy,
        tsaka mo sya patunguhan nang Tama. Ang landi mo Kasi masyado." So I made
        sure to keep this wish, and try to improve myself to help God to make
        you happy.

        So, for this valentines, all I wish is just to focus on yourself and be
        happy. I'm sorry if I'm still lacking; in my emotions that I'm
        constantly being sad over a little things, can't constraint myself and
        doing something that makes you uncomfortable, to the things that I need
        to give to you, but not giving it. I'm sorry for all of the things I
        say, I did, or I've done that made you mad, uncomfortable, and sad. I'm
        still trying to improve myself, for me and for you. And please always
        remember, even though I am giving you space sometimes, distancing
        yourself or myself, or even having misunderstanding about something,
        always remember that I loved you, I love you, and I will love you. That
        fact will not change until you declare that you don't want to anymore.
        So, I hope you enjoy this little websys that I made, and also hope you
        to have a nice valentine's day.
